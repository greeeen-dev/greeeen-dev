# hi, i'm green
I'm just a programmer who codes as a hobby.

- 🔭 Working on: Unifier and also a visual novel 👀
- 🌱 Currently learning: Java (and hopefully C/C++ in the future)
- 🤝 Collaborating with: @NullyIsHere

# Unifier
Unifier is a sophisticated bridge bot that unites servers in Discord, Revolt, and Guilded. It has multi-server support, so you can add as many servers as you'd like to the group. Do note that the Micro version only supports Discord.
