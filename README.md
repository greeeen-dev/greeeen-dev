i'm just a programmer who codes as a hobby.

- 🔭 Working on: Unifier
- 🤩 Favorite language: Python
- 🌱 Currently learning: Java (and hopefully C/C++ in the future)
- 🤝 Collaborating with: @NullyIsHere

----

I'm the lead developer of Unifier, a sophisticated bridge bot that unites servers across platforms. I aim to make this the best bridge/global chat bot out there, so we can connect with more people and escape from being locked in to a single platform, because this is what a lot of people I know and I want to have.
