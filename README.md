## My (most notable) work
### Natsumi Browser (& other skins)
I also work on Natsumi Browser, a skin for Firefox and its forks. It's meant to make your browser even more customizable than it already is while adding extra goodies as well. Somehow the head of open source at Mozilla and developers of Floorp and Firedragon noticed this, I'm not sure how that happened but I'm still proud of it.

(Note: Natsumi doesn't support Zen Browser. I have my reasons why, so please don't try to make it compatible or complain too much about it.)

### Unifier
> [!NOTE]
> This project will be sunset on April 10, 2026.

I worked on Unifier, a sophisticated bridge bot that unites servers across platforms. It was adopted by many communities to bridge their Discord servers with other platforms, though the project has now been sunset due to personal reasons.
