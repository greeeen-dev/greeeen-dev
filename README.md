## My (most notable) work
### Unifier
I'm the lead developer of Unifier, a sophisticated bridge bot that unites servers across platforms. I aim to make this the best bridge/global chat bot out there, so we can connect with more people and escape from being locked in to a single platform, because this is what a lot of people I know and I want to have.

- [Unifier Micro](https://github.com/UnifierHQ/unifier-micro) (Unifier, but core features only)

### Natsumi Browser (& other skins)
I also work on Natsumi Browser, a skin for Firefox and its forks. It's meant to make your browser even more customizable than it already is while adding extra goodies as well. Somehow the head of open source at Mozilla and developers of Floorp and Firedragon noticed this, I'm not sure how that happened but I'm still proud of it.

(Note: Natsumi doesn't support Zen Browser. I have my reasons why, so please don't try to make it compatible or complain too much about it.)

### Silkthemes
I'm the leader of the Silkbrush collective, and we work on Silkthemes. Silkthemes is an independent, community-ran alternative to Zen Mods featuring many needed improvements, developed by the Silkbrush collective.
