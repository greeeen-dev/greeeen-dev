## My (most notable) work
### Unifier
I'm the lead developer of Unifier, a sophisticated bridge bot that unites servers across platforms. I aim to make this the best bridge/global chat bot out there, so we can connect with more people and escape from being locked in to a single platform, because this is what a lot of people I know and I want to have.

- [Unifier Micro](https://github.com/UnifierHQ/unifier-micro) (Unifier, but core features only)

### Natsumi Browser (& other skins)
I also work on Natsumi Browser, a skin for Zen Browser. It's my most popular project and honestly I have NO IDEA why, especially since it's just a bunch of CSS files that aren't really as advanced as my other projects.

I also work on other skins, like Zenfox and Haruki Inbox. These aren't as actively maintained as Unifier and Natsumi are.

- ~~[Zenfox](https://github.com/greeeen-dev/zenfox)~~ (coming soon)
- [Haruki Inbox](https://github.com/greeeen-dev/haruki-inbox)

### Silkthemes
I'm the leader of the Silkbrush collective, and we work on Silkthemes. Silkthemes is an independent, community-ran alternative to Zen Mods featuring many needed improvements, developed by the Silkbrush collective.
